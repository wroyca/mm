/** Abstract base class for gestures.
 *
 * This is the base object for gesture recognition. Although this
 * object is quite generalized to serve as a base for multi-touch gestures,
 * it is suitable to implement single-touch and pointer-based gestures (using
 * the special Gdk::EventSequence value for these).
 *
 * The number of touches that a Gesture need to be recognized is controlled
 * by the n-points property. If a gesture is keeping track of less
 * or more than that number of sequences, it won't check whether the gesture
 * is recognized.
 *
 * As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, it will check
 * regularly if it is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as
 * "recognized" is left to Gesture subclasses.
 *
 * A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
 * - signal_begin() when the gesture is recognized.
 * - A number of signal_update(), whenever an input event is processed.
 * - signal_end() when the gesture is no longer recognized.
 *
 * <h2>Event propagation</h2>
 *
 * In order to receive events, a gesture needs to set a propagation phase
 * through EventController::set_propagation_phase().
 *
 * In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down to the
 * target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget
 * get a chance to interact with the event before it reaches the target.
 *
 * In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget to the
 * toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget get
 * a chance to interact with events that have not been handled yet.
 *
 * <h2>States of a sequence</h2>
 *
 * Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade of
 * Gesture%s, both across the parents of the widget receiving the
 * event and parallelly within an individual widget. It is a responsibility of the
 * widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences accordingly
 * in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the Gdk::EventSequence%s
 * triggering those.
 *
 * Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through group().
 * Grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
 * set_sequence_state() on one will effectively propagate
 * the state throughout the group.
 *
 * By default, all sequences start out in the Gtk::EventSequenceState::NONE state.
 * Sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
 * propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.
 *
 * If a sequence enters into the Gtk::EventSequenceState::DENIED state, the gesture
 * group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
 * through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
 * the touch is active.
 *
 * If a sequence enters in the Gtk::EventSequenceState::CLAIMED state, the gesture
 * group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
 * - Setting the same sequence to Gtk::EventSequenceState::DENIED on every other gesture
 *   group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets in the propagation
 *   chain.
 * - emitting signal_cancel() on every gesture in widgets underneath in the
 *   propagation chain.
 * - Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.
 *
 * @note If a sequence is set early to Gtk::EventSequenceState::CLAIMED on
 * Gdk::Event::Type::TOUCH_BEGIN/Gdk::Event::Type::BUTTON_PRESS (so those events are captured before
 * reaching the event widget, this implies Gtk::PropagationPhase::CAPTURE), one similar
 * event will be emulated if the sequence changes to Gtk::EventSequenceState::DENIED.
 * This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
 * again.
 *
 * Sequence states can't be changed freely, see set_sequence_state()
 * to know about the possible lifetimes of a Gdk::EventSequence.
