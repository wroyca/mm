/* Why reinterpret_cast<ExpressionWatchBase*>(gobject) is needed:
 *
 * A ExpressionWatchBase instance is in fact always a GtkExpressionWatch instance.
 * Unfortunately, GtkExpressionWatch cannot be a member of ExpressionWatchBase,
 * because it is an opaque struct.  Also, the C interface does not provide
 * any hooks to install a destroy notification handler, thus we cannot
 * wrap it dynamically either.
 *
 * The cast works because ExpressionWatchBase does not have any member data, and
 * it is impossible to derive from it.  This is ensured by using final on the
 * class and by using = delete on the default constructor.
