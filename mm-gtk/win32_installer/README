To create the installer, first build all libraries with both mingw (with
documentation enabled, you will need doxygen and graphviz for this) and MSVC
(both Debug and Release). 'make install' non-optimized debug mingw-built ones
to the /gtkmm_debug prefix, and the optimized non-debug mingw-built ones to
the /gtkmm_release prefix.

Build gtkmm-documentation on a linux machine, install it into a temporary
prefix and move $prefix/share to /gtkmm_debug/share in MSYS. I have not yet
succeeded in building gtkmm-documentation on Windows directly.

Then, run the build-installer script. You might need to adjust some paths
in the install-msvc-module script. I hope to generalize the script to
always find the correct paths in the near future.
