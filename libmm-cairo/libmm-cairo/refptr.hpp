 * Reference counting means that a shared reference count is incremented each
 * time a %RefPtr is copied, and decremented each time a %RefPtr is destroyed,
 * for instance when it leaves its scope. When the reference count reaches
 * zero, the contained object is deleted
 *
 * cairomm uses %RefPtr so that you don't need to remember
 * to delete the object explicitly, or know when a method expects you to delete 
 * the object that it returns, and to prevent any need to manually  reference 
 * and unreference cairo objects.

// 2. When the RefPtr constructor is called only from make_refptr_for_instance(),
//    future changes, if necessary, are easier to make.
