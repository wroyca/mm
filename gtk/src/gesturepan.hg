 * construct time, and can be changed through set_orientation().

 * When the gesture starts to be recognized, GesturePan will
 * attempt to determine as early as possible whether the sequence
 * is moving in the expected direction, and denying the sequence if
 * this does not happen.
 *
 * Once a panning gesture along the expected axis is recognized,
 * signal_pan() will be emitted as input events
 * are received, containing the offset in the given axis.
