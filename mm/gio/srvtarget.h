/** DNS SRV record target
 *
 * SRV (service) records are used by some network protocols to provide
 * service-specific aliasing and load-balancing. For example, XMPP (Jabber) uses
 * SRV records to locate the XMPP server for a domain; rather than connecting
 * directly to "example.com" or assuming a specific server hostname like
 * "xmpp.example.com", an XMPP client would look up the "xmpp-client" SRV record
 * for "example.com", and then connect to whatever host was pointed to by that
 * record.
 *
 * You can use Resolver::lookup_service() or Resolver::lookup_service_async()
 * to find the SrvTargets for a given service. However, if you are simply
 * planning to connect to the remote service, you can use NetworkService's
 * SocketConnectable interface and not need to worry about SrvTarget at all.
