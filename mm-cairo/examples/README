Examples:

  surfaces: demonstrates how to use various surface types
  text: various examples of drawing text

These examples are built automatically as part of cairomm, and you can
easily try them out if you are building from source. If cairomm has been
installed on your system, you can compile an example program with

    g++ main.cc `pkg-config --cflags --libs cairomm-1.16` -std=c++17

with main.cc replaced by the name of the program you want to build.
