Building cairomm-1.16 with Visual Studio .NET 2017 or later

* You will need Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 15.0).  Building with Visual Studio 2015 or earlier is no longer supported.
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development files from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/ and add
  the paths to headers and import libraries to Visual Studio, if they are not already in $(srcroot)/../vs15/$(Platform).
* In a Visual Studio command prompt, go to $(srcroot)\MSVC_NMake
* Build using nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=[release|debug]
* Run the tests.
* Now the built DLL and .lib files use the toolset version ('vc141' for Visual Studio 2017 and 'vc142' for Visual Studio
  2019) instead of the Visual Studio version ('vc150' for Visual Studio 2017) by default.  If using the old naming style,
  please note that libsigc++-3.x must be built with this option enabled as well, if building it with NMake.
  For the Meson builds, pass in the option '-Dmsvc14x-parallel-installable=false' to the Meson configure command line
  to avoid having the toolset version in the final DLL and .lib filenames; again, this is only recommended if it is
  inconvenient to re-build the dependent code, and this option should be used when building items that depend on cairomm,
  if this option is provided.
